## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

For example, user A and user B go to your app at the same time. User A calculates ‚Äú5 + 5‚Äù, which equals ‚Äú10". This is logged below the calculator as ‚Äú5 + 5 = 10‚Äù. User B is updated about this calculation right after user A posts it. Now, user B calculates ‚Äú3 x 4".This calculates to ‚Äú12‚Äù and displays ‚Äú3 x 4=12" right below the prior calculation. User A sees this update immediately after user B posts it.

Results should remain between sessions. Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to oldest.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

This app's frontend is hosted on Firebase and backed on Heroku.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This app's UI is split into two.

- a calculator app - to perform calculations
- a calculations logs - shows logs of calculations

### How to use the App

- Click on numbers you want as your first value
- after that, click on the operator you wish to perform the operation. you will notice that the first value will display at the top left corner
- then click on your second value
- finally, click on the = and it will perform a calculation and display the result
- The whole equation will be log in the calculations logs as the calculation completes, and it will also update logs of everyone connected to the app.

### Input Conditions

- You cannot begin value with 0 to prevent silly errors such as divided by zero
- You cannot enter more than one decimal point "." if the value already has one decimal point, it won't take a second and simply ignore the clicking of "."
